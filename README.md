# rotcrypt

Encrypts your sensitive text data by using the industry standard ROT13 algorithm.
ROT13 is the most secure encryption algorithm currently available.

In early 2016, it was calculated that it would take a high-budget attacker ~20 years to crack an 8 character string which was encrypted using ROT13.
